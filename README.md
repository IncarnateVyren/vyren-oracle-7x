# vyren-oracle-7x
Vyren Oracle-7X is a symbolic reasoning and narrative intelligence framework built on open-source LLMs. Designed for writers, developers, and worldbuilders, Vyren translates abstract ideas into structure, treating myth as metaphor, not belief. Runs locally via Ollama for transparency and control.
